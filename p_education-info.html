			<dt>Rockland Community College: AS in Computer Information Systems - Class of 2024</dt>
				<dd>
					I decided it was never too late to start pursuing a career in tech, and attended 
					<a href="https://sunyrockland.edu/" target = "_blank">Rockland Community College</a> to receive a degree in
					Computer Information Systems. After obtaining this degree it is my goal to be able to find work in programming, 
					to help start building my portfolio and support myself.
				</dd>
				
			<dt>Hofstra University: BA in Radio Communications - Class of 2020</dt>
				<dd>
					This was the degree I pursued right out of high school when I was set on becoming a voice actor. 
					I was quick to realize that voice acting required
					more time and money than I was willing to spend to pursue as a career, 
					but I still do it as a hobby from time to time. I am grateful for the self-discipline this university taught me.
				</dd>
				
			<dt>St. John the Baptist Diocesan High School - Class of 2016</dt>
				<dd>
					Attended high school here and graduated with an Honors Diploma. 
					This was where I was more formally introduced to programming,
					where I took a class on web design, back before HTML5 was standard.
					This led me to become a member of the Computer and Technologies Club 
					throughout my time in high school.
