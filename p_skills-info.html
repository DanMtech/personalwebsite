        <dt>Programming in Python</dt>
            <dd>
                I started learning python in 2022, and am continuing to bolster my skills everyday, as it has 
                easily become one of my favorite programming languages.
            </dd>
            
        <dt>Programming in Java</dt>
            <dd>
                I began learning programming in Java in 2021. While it isn't one of my favorite programming langauages,
                I have knowledge of programming concepts carried out in Java, and respect it as an industry standard.
            </dd>
            
        <dt>Microsoft Office Suite, inculding knowledge of Excel and Access</dt>
            <dd>
                I've been using Microsoft Office since I was young, and am very familar with its functions.
                I am confident in my skill to use the more technical parts of Office, like Excel and Access.
            </dd>
        
        <dt>Computer Troubleshooting Skills</dt>
            <dd>
               I consider myself rather tech-savvy, and am many peoples' go-to "techie", when it comes
               to troubleshooting problems with computer electronics. I credit my knowledge by the problems
               I face with computers everyday. If it were not for running into my own computer issues, I 
               would not know nearly as much as I do now about troubleshooting.
            </dd>

        <dt>Verbal and Written Communication Skills</dt>
            <dd>
               I communicate with several people everyday of my life. Whether that be via phone, email, or text,
               I pride myself on my excellent written and verbal communication skills. I believe communication is 
               one of the most important skills one can have.
