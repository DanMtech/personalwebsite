			<dt>Tabletop Roleplaying Games</dt>
				<dd>
					For over 10 years, I have been a Game Master (GM) for several different 
					Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPGs). I run sessions weekly with my friends as
					players, and it is one of my favorite hobbies. I started using Dungeons and 
					Dragons 5th Edition, but have since expanded and have played using several
					systems.
				</dd>
				
			<dt>Video Games</dt>
				<dd>
					Along with TTRPGs I also enjoy traditional video games, and play on both consoles and
					PC. A game I've gotten into recently has been <a href="https://www.odysseyinteractive.gg/omegastrikers" 
					target="_blank">Omega Strikers.</a> It is a 3v3 skill based game that kind of plays
					like air hockey.
				</dd>
				
			<dt>Voice-Over</dt>
				<dd>
					From time to time, I enjoy voiceover, whether it be for animated characters, 
					narration, or commercials, I very much enjoy acting behind a microphone. 
					Below you can listen to one of my old commercial voiceover demos I have made.
