		If you're on this website you're probably wondering what I can do for you as an employee. 
		For starters, this entire website you are viewing has been hand-coded by me in HTML5. 
		I am a self-starting, team player with beginner knowledge of key programming languages such as Python and Java. 
		I've been interested in programming since I was young, where I made attempts at re-coding old Pokemon games to make my own. 
		My goal as a programmer is to help to create software and technology that can help people to make their lives easier 
		and take the tedious tasks of life and automate them.
